Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success. If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers.

For example, after memory is de-allocated, an operating system may make the memory available to another process, or disk space may be reallocated when a file is deleted. As removing information requires time and additional resources, operating systems do not usually clear the previously written information. Even when the resource is reused by the same process, this weakness can arise when new data is not as large as the old data, which leaves portions of the old data still available. Equivalent errors can occur in other situations where the length of data is variable but the associated data structure is not. If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated. This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:459:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:212:VIEW ID:1000::NATURE:CanPrecede:CWE ID:201:VIEW ID:1000::,"::ORDINALITY:Primary::",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Technology-Independent:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data::","::METHOD:Manual Analysis:DESCRIPTION:Write a known pattern into each sensitive location.

See Terminology Notes for further explanation of some concepts. Cryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time. If a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is broken). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack. Cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered. As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly. If ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences. This weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:327:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"::ORDINALITY:Primary::",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:OS-Independent:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Architecture-Independent:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:NOTE:This weakness is primarily introduced during the architecture and design phase as risky primitives are included.::PHASE:Implementation:NOTE:Even in cases where the Architectural phase properly specifies a cryptographically secure design, the design may be changed during implementation due to unforeseen constraints.::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:IMPACT:Read Application Data:LIKELIHOOD:High:NOTE:Incorrect usage of crypto primitives could render the supposedly encrypted data as unencrypted plaintext in the worst case.::","::METHOD:Architecture or Design Review:DESCRIPTION:Review requirements, documentation, and product design to ensure that primitives are consistent with the strongest-available recommendations from trusted parties.

As of CWE 4.6, CWE terminology around primitives and algorithms is emerging as shown by the following example, subject to future consultation and agreement within the CWE and cryptography communities. Suppose one wishes to send encrypted data using a CLI tool such as OpenSSL. One might choose to use AES with a 256-bit key and require tamper protection (GCM mode, for instance). For compatibility's sake, one might also choose the ciphertext to be formatted to the PKCS#5 standard. In this case, the cryptographic system would be AES-256-GCM with PKCS#5 formatting. The cryptographic function would be AES-256 in the GCM mode of operation, and the algorithm would be AES. Colloquially, one would say that AES (and sometimes AES-256) is the cryptographic primitive, because it is the algorithm that realizes the concept of symmetric encryption (without modes of operation or other protocol related modifications). In practice, developers and architects typically refer to base cryptographic algorithms (AES, SHA, etc.) as cryptographic primitives.::TYPE:Maintenance:NOTE:Since CWE 4.4, various cryptography-related entries, including CWE-327 and CWE-1240, have been slated for extensive research, analysis, and community consultation to define consistent terminology, improve relationships, and reduce overlap or duplication.

Margining the clock consists of varying the clock frequency until an anomaly occurs. This could be a continuous frequency change or it could be a single cycle. The single cycle method is described here. For every 1000th clock pulse, the clock cycle is shortened by 10 percent. If no effect is observed, the width is shortened by 20%. This process is continued in 10% increments up to and including 50%. Note that the cycle time may be increased as well, down to seconds per cycle. Separately, the voltage is margined. Note that the voltage could be increased or decreased. Increasing the voltage has limits, as the circuitry may not be able to withstand a drastically increased voltage.

1251,"Mirrored Regions with Different Values",Base,Incomplete,"The product's architecture mirrors regions without ensuring that their contents always stay in sync.","Having mirrored regions with different values might result in the exposure of sensitive information or possibly system compromise. In the interest of increased performance, one might need to duplicate a resource. A cache memory is a common example of this concept, which keeps a local copy of a data element in the high speed cache memory. Unfortunately, this speed improvement comes with a downside, since the product needs to ensure that the local copy always mirrors the original copy truthfully. If they get out of sync, the computational result is no longer true. During hardware design, memory is not the only item which gets mirrored. There are many other entities that get mirrored, as well: registers, memory regions, and, in some cases, even whole computational units. For example, within a multi-core processor, if all memory accesses for each and every core goes through a single Memory-Management Unit (MMU) then the MMU will become a performance bottleneck. In such cases, duplicating local MMUs that will serve only a subset of the cores rather than all of them may resolve the performance issue. These local copies are also called shadow copies or mirrored copies. If the original resource never changed, local duplicate copies getting out of sync would never be an issue. However, the values of the original copy will sometimes change. When the original copy changes, the mirrored copies must also change, and change fast. This situation of shadow-copy-possibly-out-of-sync-with-original-copy might occur as a result of multiple scenarios, including the following: After the values in the original copy change, due to some reason the original copy does not send the update request to its shadow copies. After the values in the original copy change, the original copy dutifully sends the update request to its shadow copies, but due to some reason the shadow copy does not execute this update request. After the values in the original copy change, the original copy sends the update request to its shadow copies, and the shadow copy executes this update request faithfully. However, during the small time period when the original copy has new values and the shadow copy is still holding the old values, an attacker can exploit the old values. Then it becomes a race condition between the attacker and the update process of who can reach the target, shadow copy first, and, if the attacker reaches first, the attacker wins. The attacker might send a spoofed update request to the target shadow copy, pretending that this update request is coming from the original copy. This spoofed request might cause the targeted shadow copy to update its values to some attacker-friendly values, while the original copies remain unchanged by the attacker. Suppose a situation where the original copy has a system of reverting back to its original value if it does not hear back from all the shadow copies that such copies have successfully completed the update request. In such a case, an attack might occur as follows: (1) the original copy might send an update request; (2) the shadow copy updates it; (3) the shadow copy sends back the successful completion message; (4) through a separate issue, the attacker is able to intercept the shadow copy's completion message. In this case, the original copy thinks that the update did not succeed, hence it reverts to its original value. Now there is a situation where the original copy has the old value, and the shadow copy has the new value.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1250:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE NAME:VHDL:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::LANGUAGE NAME:Verilog:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:OS-Independent:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Architecture-Independent:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:SCOPE:Accountability:SCOPE:Authentication:SCOPE:Authorization:SCOPE:Non-Repudiation:IMPACT:Varies by Context::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Whenever there are multiple, physically different copies of the same value that might change and the process to update them is not instantaneous and atomic, it is impossible to assert that the original and shadow copies will always be in sync - there will always be a time period when they are out of sync.

Software-controllable mechanisms to dynamically scale device voltage and frequency and monitor power consumption are common features in today's chipsets, but they also enable attackers to mount fault injection and side-channel attacks without having physical access to the device. Fault injection attacks involve strategic manipulation of bits in a device to achieve a desired effect such as skipping an authentication step, elevating privileges, or altering the output of a cryptographic operation. Manipulation of the device clock and voltage supply is a well-known technique to inject faults and is cheap to implement with physical device access.

A possible result is that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory region but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory region.","Hardware product designs often need to implement memory protection features that enable privileged software to define isolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies. Isolated memory regions can be defined on different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address, memory mapped IO). Each memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. It is possible to map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell. This is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address decoding logic. If one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. Memory aliases can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full system address. A common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory address. Such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory.

This means that the public key forms the root of trust, which necessitates that the public key itself must be protected and used properly. During the development phase, debug firmware enables many hardware debug hooks, debug modes, and debug messages for testing. Those debug facilities provide significant, additional views about the firmware’s capability and, in some cases, additional capability into the chip or SoC. If compromised, these capabilities could be exploited by an attacker to take full control of the system. Once the product exits the manufacturing stage and enters production, it is good practice to use a different public key. Debug firmware images are known to leak. With the debug key being reused as the production key, the debug image will also work on the production image. Thus, it will open all the internal, debug capabilities to the attacker.

Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc. Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow registers. Shadow registers and mirror registers typically refer to registers that can be accessed from multiple addresses. Writing to or reading from the aliased/mirrored address has the same effect as writing to the address of the main register. They are typically implemented within an IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data will later be updated to the main register, and both registers will be in synch. If the shadow registers are not access-protected, attackers could simply initiate transactions to the shadow registers and compromise system security.",::NATURE:PeerOf:CWE ID:1191:VIEW ID:1194:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:420:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:288:VIEW ID:1000::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:OS-Independent:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Architecture-Independent:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Microcontroller Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Processor Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY NAME:Bus/Interface Hardware:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Technology-Independent:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Availability:SCOPE:Access Control:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:DoS: Resource Consumption (Other):IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:IMPACT:Gain Privileges or Assume Identity:IMPACT:Alter Execution Logic:IMPACT:Bypass Protection Mechanism:IMPACT:Quality Degradation:LIKELIHOOD:High::","","::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Protect assets from accesses against all potential interfaces and alternate paths.:EFFECTIVENESS:Defense in Depth::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2017-18293:DESCRIPTION:When GPIO is protected by blocking access to corresponding GPIO resource registers, protection can be bypassed by writing to the corresponding banked GPIO registers instead.:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18293::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-15483:DESCRIPTION:monitor device allows access to physical UART debug port without authentication:LINK:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15483::",,,"",::554::,"",

1342,"Information Exposure through Microarchitectural State after Transient Execution",Base,Incomplete,"The processor does not properly clear microarchitectural state after incorrect microcode assists or speculative execution, resulting in transient execution.","In many processor architectures an exception, mis-speculation, or microcode assist results in a flush operation to clear results that are no longer required. This action prevents these results from influencing architectural state that is intended to be visible from software. However, traces of this transient execution may remain in microarchitectural buffers, resulting in a change in microarchitectural state that can expose sensitive information to an attacker using side-channel analysis. For example, Load Value Injection (LVI) [REF-1202] can exploit direct injection of erroneous values into intermediate load and store buffers. Several conditions may need to be fulfilled for a successful attack: 1) incorrect transient execution that results in remanence of sensitive information; 2) attacker has the ability to provoke microarchitectural exceptions; 3) operations and structures in victim code that can be exploited must be identified.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:226:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:226:VIEW ID:1194:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:OS-Independent:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Workstation:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:x86:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:ARM:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE NAME:Other:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:Technology-Independent:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Requirements::","",,"::SCOPE:Confidentiality:SCOPE:Integrity:IMPACT:Modify Memory:IMPACT:Read Memory:IMPACT:Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands:LIKELIHOOD:Medium::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Hardware ensures that no illegal data flows from faulting micro-ops exists at the microarchitectural level.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Build and Compilation:DESCRIPTION:Include instructions that explicitly remove traces of unneeded computations from software interactions with microarchitectural elements e.g. lfence, sfence, mfence, clflush.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::","::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-0551:DESCRIPTION:Load value injection in some processors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to enable information disclosure via a side-channel with local access.:LINK:http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-0551::",,,"",,"::TYPE:Relationship:NOTE:CWE-1342 differs from CWE-1303, which is related to misprediction and biasing microarchitectural components, while CWE-1342 addresses illegal data flows and retention.

1351,"Improper Handling of Hardware Behavior in Exceptionally Cold Environments",Base,Incomplete,"A hardware device, or the firmware running on it, is missing or has incorrect protection features to maintain goals of security primitives when the device is cooled below standard operating temperatures.","The hardware designer may improperly anticipate hardware behavior when exposed to exceptionally cold conditions. As a result they may introduce a weakness by not accounting for the modified behavior of critical components when in extreme environments. An example of a change in behavior is that power loss won't clear/reset any volatile state when cooled below standard operating temperatures. This may result in a weakness when the starting state of the volatile memory is being relied upon for a security decision. For example, a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) may be supplied as a security primitive to improve confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity guarantees. However, when the PUF is paired with DRAM, SRAM, or another temperature sensitive entropy source, the system designer may introduce weakness by failing to account for the chosen entropy source's behavior at exceptionally low temperatures. In the case of DRAM and SRAM, when power is cycled at low temperatures, the device will not contain the bitwise biasing caused by inconsistencies in manufacturing and will instead contain the data from previous boot. Should the PUF primitive be used in a cryptographic construction which does not account for full adversary control of PUF seed data, weakness would arise. This weakness does not cover Cold Boot Attacks wherein RAM or other external storage is super cooled and read externally by an attacker.",::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1384:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::,"",::LANGUAGE CLASS:Language-Independent:LANGUAGE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::OPERATING SYSTEM CLASS:OS-Independent:OPERATING SYSTEM PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Embedded:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::ARCHITECTURE CLASS:Microcomputer:ARCHITECTURE PREVALENCE:Undetermined::TECHNOLOGY CLASS:System on Chip:TECHNOLOGY PREVALENCE:Undetermined::,"","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design::PHASE:Implementation::","",,"::SCOPE:Integrity:SCOPE:Authentication:IMPACT:Varies by Context:IMPACT:Unexpected State:LIKELIHOOD:Low:NOTE:Consequences of this weakness are highly contextual.::","","::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:The system should account for security primitive behavior when cooled outside standard temperatures.::","",,,"",,"",
